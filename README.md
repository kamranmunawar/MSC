## fastMRI: AI-Driven MRI Enhancement 
Collaborative research with Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and NYU Langone Health 

Implemented a fastMRI U-Net model in PyTorch to accelerate MRI scans, focusing on knee pathology using masks and heatmaps to prioritize key regions. 

Developed an end-to-end training pipeline, leveraging the MRNet and fastMRI datasets for heatmap generation and image reconstruction. 

Applied weighted loss functions and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance. 

Generated and evaluated performance metrics, providing a robust framework for further experimentation.

## Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction 

Applied clustering algorithms (K-Means, GMM) and evaluated performance using the Silhouette Score. 

Implemented dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, ICA, Random Projection (RP), and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), to reduce noise and simplify datasets while preserving key information.

## Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) 

Explored MDPs through the Forest Management Problem, demonstrating decision-making under uncertainty. 

Analyzed three key MDP-solving algorithms: Value Iteration (VI), Policy Iteration (PI), and Q-Learning, comparing their effectiveness in dynamic environments.

## Optimization Algorithms 

Implemented and compared four local random search algorithms: Randomized Hill Climbing (RHC), Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and MIMIC. 

Applied these algorithms to three distinct optimization problems, analyzing their varying behaviors and performance. 

## Black-Box Optimization with Bayesian Techniques 

Optimized eight black-box functions using Bayesian optimization, utilizing GaussianProcessRegressor and botorch.acquisition modules. 

Efficiently navigated and exploited the search space to improve performance in optimizing black-box functions.

## School information on the map

In this project, I gather school rating data from Ofsted and postcode information from the Office for National Statistics. The objective is to merge these datasets and visualize the school information on a map using the plotly.graph_objects library. By combining the school ratings with geographical data, I can create an interactive map that provides valuable insights into the distribution and quality of schools across the desired area
